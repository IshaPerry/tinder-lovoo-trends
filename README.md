# About the Project 
 
 Analyze user data from the "Lovoo" dating app, Tinder user profile characterisitics, and gonorrhea rates to study the following:
  
* Determine how perceived beauty standards may effect user desirability on dating apps, measured by a calculated quantity called “Profile Success Percentage”
* Identify key user profile features that result in higher profile visits and profile success percentages, so users can maximize their success on dating apps
* Study user demographics to fine locations where dating apps are the most popular
* Identify if there is a correlation between the increase in Tinder subscribers and overall increase in UK gonorrhea rates between 2015 and 2020
